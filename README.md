# beoble Frontend Task

## Intoduction
This is a takehome project for beoble's frontend interview.

## Get Started
Run ```npm install``` to install packages.
Run ```npm run start``` to start the project.

## Remarks
Created a resuable card (inspired with pancakeswap UI) that displays:
1. Wallet Address
2. Wallet Balance 
3. Chain ID
4. Ethereum Name Service (If no ENS, it will not be displayed)
5. Ethereum Name Service Avatr (If no ENS, default avatar will be displayed)

You are also able to sign any message, and verify it after that to receive your public address.
Comes complete with error alerts if something goes wrong and code comments.

Reusable card created with max width of 600px and min width of 375px (mobile) with a breakpoint of 576px.

> I am using node version v17.9.1, npm version 8.11.0. But I believe it should work with other versions.
